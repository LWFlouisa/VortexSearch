# VortexSearch
A way of shortening the search queries when looking for files.

## Phind Interpretation
The [VortexSearch repository](https://github.com/LWFlouisa/VortexSearch.git) is a Perl implementation that aims to shorten search queries when looking for files. It does so by creating rulesets that define specific search patterns.

Based on the provided code snippet:

```perl
Multisearch::CreateModes.from_list_modulate
Multisearch::SearchFiles.transition
```

Here's an educated guess on how this repository relates to multisearch functionality:

- `Multisearch::CreateModes.from_list_modulate`: This line suggests that the module `Multisearch` has a method called `CreateModes.from_list_modulate`, which likely creates a new mode for multisearch based on a list of modulators. The term "modulate" implies that the search query may be altered, possibly by applying filters or transformations.

- `Multisearch::SearchFiles.transition`: This line implies that the `Multisearch` module has a method called `SearchFiles.transition`, which possibly transitions the search functionality from one state to another. This could be related to changing the search pattern, ruleset, or other search parameters during the search process.

In summary, the repository seems to provide a way to create and transition between different search modes and rulesets, allowing users to efficiently search for files by shortening and customizing their search queries.
